Hands-on Machine Learning with Image Classification & More!

I'm excited to share my new GitHub repository where I explored core ML techniques through practical tasks — using real-world image data and classic algorithms like SVM and Random Forest.

📌 Key Highlights from this mini-project series:

🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification using SVM

✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using Random Forest

Clean image preprocessing using OpenCV

Pure Machine Learning (no deep learning)
